# The Coder's Quest

A blog created by a new web developer for new web developers. I share my experiences, good and bad, in creating projects on my own.

The project is still underdevelopment. Additional features will be added.

## Project Description

This is a Javascript/React app, configured on Firebase. Cloud Firestore is used to store the files containing the content.

Almost all the content is created using Markdown, stored in \*.md files. The files for the posts contain metadata, which is parsed out using the npm package `parse-md`. Markdown is rendered using `react-markdown`.

A minimal amount of `semantic-ui-react` is used in 1 component. Otherwise, all the styling was done with CSS.
