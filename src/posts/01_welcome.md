Welcome to the **_Lonesome Coder_** blog. My name is John, and I'm trying to transition from a previous career path to becoming a web developer. I have a MERN full-stack boot camp certificate, so I've learned some basics. Where do I go from here, and how do I get there? That's the subject of this blog.

### What is Not Included

Since I consider myself a beginner, you won't find original insights on better coding. Rather, it's the process of figuring out what to do and how to do it that is the focus. Links to content by actual experts will be included.

### The Story

There a many decisions to be made, obstacles to overcome, failures and successes when creating a new project (like this blog). I'll share my experiences, and invite you to share yours.
